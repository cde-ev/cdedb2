# This is a script to handle diffs of .po files.
#
# It ignores all lines starting with '#:' to ignore changes to line numbers
# where translatable strings are used.
#
# To set this up, add the following to your .git/config file:
#
# [diff "podiff"]
#   textconv = i18n/po-comments-filter
#
# Then add the following line to your .git/info/attributes file:
#
# *.po diff=podiff
#
