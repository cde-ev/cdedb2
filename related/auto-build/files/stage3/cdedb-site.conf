	## Server Certificate:
	# Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate. If the certificate
	# is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a pass phrase. Note that a

	# and a DSA certificate you can configure both in parallel (to also allow
	# the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)

	## Server Private Key:
	# If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this directive to
	# point at the key file. Keep in mind that if you've both a RSA and a DSA
	# private key you can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of

	## SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	# The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	# approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait
	# for the close notify alert from client. When you need a different
	# shutdown approach you can use one of the following variables:

	## ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	# This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	# SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates the
	# SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use this when
	# you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where mod_ssl
	# sends the close notify alert.

	## ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	# This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	# SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	# alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	# practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	# this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation works
	# correctly.
	# Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	# keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	# keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	# Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	# their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	# "force-response-1.0" for this.
