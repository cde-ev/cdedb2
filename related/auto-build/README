===================================================

This make directory builds and runs the virtual
machines needed for the course "Softwaresicherheit"
at the CdE Winterakademie 2009. It is a shortened version
of the one that was actually used.

It assumes that the following software is installed already.

- qemu is installed
  so far, succesfully tested on
  + qemu 0.9.1s.20080620 (FreeBSD port emulators/qemu-devel as of 2008/11/02)

- the GNU version of the make utility (usually called gmake on *BSD machines)

- the BSD version of tar (often called bsdtar on gnu/linux machines)

Knobs:
The following are the make variables you most probably want to set.

DISTDIR       The directory where downloaded files are to be stored.
              Write permissions are needed if and only if distribution
              files are missing. If all the needed files are
              downloaded already (or you happen to have them on your
              machine for some reason anyway), this directory can be
              read-only. Symbolic links are honored.
 
              Defaults to ../distfiles

WORKDIR       The directory where all generated data is stored. This
              is the only directory where write permissions are
              absolutely necessary (note that the directory this
              README resides in can safely be read-only, if the
              workdir is set to some writable place outside). After a
              sucessful build, this directory can safely be removed
              (the clean target will do this for you). So you may have
              this directory on a ram-disk.

              Defaults to ./work. 

IMAGEDIR      The directory where the build images are to be
              stored. All the install-* targets need write permissions
              in this directory. The build targets only need write
              permissions, if they depend on an image not yet present
              in the image directory already.

              Defaults to ../images-winter09

Warnings:
~~~~~~~~~

* For debugging purpose, qemu is usually startet *without* the option -no-graphics.
  That is, qemu will bring up (in a blocking way) a new window, which, depending 
  on the preferences of your window-manager may or may not require user interaction
  (it does, e.g., if you have rudeness 0 in ratpoision). For a fully automatic
  build, use QEMUOPTIONS=-nographic.


Usage:
~~~~~~

* First build the base system. This might take an hour. So best do such things before
  going to lunch. Also make sure you read the warning about QEMUOPTIONS above. 

    (g)make install-base clean

* The game can be build with (g)make install clean. This will preserve any existing base
  immage (takes a few minutes, mainly for rsync -S to duplicate a sparse file).
  (g)make run will then start the ready made game image for you.
