On :doc:`Development_Environment_Setup`
you can find everything to setup the prebuild VM-image.
This can be used for developing and offline usage.
Alternatively you can look on :doc:`Development_Environment_Setup_Docker`
where you can find instruction on how to use the docker container.
If you want to use the VM for developing purpose,
you should take a look at :doc:`Development_Environment_Development`
after reading either the page about setting up the VM or Docker.

The page about :doc:`Development_Environment_Manual` is mostly for documentation purpose --
it is strongly recommended to use the prebuild VM-image or the Docker container.
