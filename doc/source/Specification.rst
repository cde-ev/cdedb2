Specification
=============

This page aggregates the thoughts about design specifications. This is
mostly a concentrate of emails sent by users. This is somewhat competing
with the design sections in the introduction, but those focus on the
developer perspective of things. All points should provide a source, so we
can ask questions in case of confusion.

General Thoughts
----------------

* If there are numerical identifiers to be processed by a human, provide
  something more meaninful if sensible. Example: In the event organization,
  instead of only listing course numbers, provide short titles of the
  courses. (Simone Rupp)
