Role Model
==========

Personas
--------

Each persona can have the following privileges:

* being a persona (in contrast to anonymous access)
* access to a specific realm (cde, event, ml, assembly)
* admin privileges in a realm (core, cde, event, ml, assembly)
* meta admin
* finance admin
* cdelokal admin
* auditor
* membership
* searchability

Note that these roles can not be awarded independently. First, every persona
has in fact ml access currently, and each admin role requires access
privileges in the corresponding realm. Here, core, cde and finance admin
roles require cde realm access, with finance admins additionally requiring
cde adminship. These rules regarding admin privileges are in fact enforced
redundantly by database constraints and the ``extract_roles`` function.

Furthermore, there is a realm inheritance in place, with higher realms
implying the access to lower realms. In practice, cde access implies
event and assembly access, while they in turn imply ml access.

This leads to the role inheritance graph shown below. Here, privileges
which can be lost are shown in round boxes, while privileges in cornered
boxes can only be gained. Therefore, former members are those with cde realm
without membership privileges.

These privileges control what actions the user may call and are determined
by the core.personas table. These are enforced throughout the python code
via the ``@access`` decorator.

Additionally there may be finer grained privileges which are encoded in
various tables which are checked locally in the relevant pieces of code. The
following additional privileges are

* orga of an event
* moderator of a mailinglist
* presider of an assembly

Due to complex inter-realm dependencies, mailinglist privileges have some caveats
which are explained further at :doc:`Realm_Mailinglist_Privileges`.

A privacy-focused overview of which personal data other users may access
under which conditions can be found at :doc:`Realm_Core_Privacy`.

Realm Admins
------------

Realm admins have full access to the entities in there realm, i.e. assembly admins to
assemblies, cde admins to past events, event admins to events, and ml admins to
mailinglists. Since all personas live in the core realm, core admins have full access
to all personas.

Additionally realm admins have full access to users that belong to their realm, but not
to any higher or equivalent realm. For example an event admin may manage, create and
view all simple event-users, but not a user that belongs to the event and the assembly
realm or a user belonging to the cde realm (i.e. a former or current member).

Special Admins
--------------

Meta Admins
^^^^^^^^^^^

Meta admins have no actual privileges except that they are the only ones who can grant
or revoke admin privileges. Doing so requires the approval of two meta admins.

Finance Admins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finance admins must be cde admins aswell and are the only ones with access to the
semester management where payment reminders and address checks are sent, inactive
member ejected and the balance of members is updated. In addition they may manage,
create and revoke lastschrift permits.

CdELokal Admins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CdELokal admins may manage and create cdelokal mailinglists.

Auditors
^^^^^^^^

Auditors are special, since they do not actually have any privileges, except that they
may view all log pages.

Droids
------

Each droid can have the following privileges:

* being a droid (in contrast to anonymous access)
* per droid identity privilege
* infrastructure toggle (making them exempt from lockdown)

More to droids at :doc:`API_Droids`.


Database
--------

In the database everything is mapped onto four tiers

* anonymous,
* persona,
* member,
* admin.

More to database at :doc:`Design_Database`.
