Orga Hints
==========

This page aims to provide orgas with the necessary knowledge to successfully
use the DB for event organization.

Introduction
------------

After the event was created in the DB by the administrators you see several
links to customize your event. Most actions should be pretty straight
forward, the others should be explained here.

Every event consists of one or more parts. For events with only one part
this should introduce only minimal overhead. If your event has courses,
creating them will be one of the first steps.

When your event is ready, you start the registration. Note that without a
configured leagal form for minors no minors wil be able to register. The
registration is minimalistic and all additional information you want to
exchange or store about a registration is delegated to additional per event
fields which are managed through the normal event configuration. There you
can also configure a questionnaire to let the participants fill in these
fields.

The registrations can be queried with a sophisticated mask which should
allow generation of pretty much any interesting data set. One exception are
course choices which have their own place.
