Realms
======

.. todo:: add some more explanation to why we separate in which way into realms

The realms group functionality into semantic units. There are four major
realms which have frontend, backend.

* cde -- CdE specific section
* event -- events like academies
* ml -- mailing lists
* assembly -- annual CdE assemblies

Then there are some more specialised realms.

* core -- basic infrastructure, servicing all realms
* session -- backend only, used for resolving session keys stored in cookies
