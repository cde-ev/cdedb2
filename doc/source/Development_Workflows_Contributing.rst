Contributing
============

Contributions should mainly be done by opening pull requests in Gitea. To get
access to the repository, please
`click yourself an account <https://tracker.cde-ev.de/gitea/user/sign_up>`_
and contact us at cdedb Ã¤t lists.cde-ev.de.

We currently do not have any continuous integration. However, its is good style
to write a new or extend an existing test to cover the new introduced code.
Please take a look into :doc:`Development_Workflows_Test_Suite`.

If you add new dependencies or change something inside the database, leave a
*Deployment Hint* by adding a line in the commit message starting with
``Deploy:`` and followed by a description what to change in the live instance.
It is good style to write an evolution script if you change the database schema.
Please take a look into :doc:`Development_Workflows_Scripts` and mention the
script name in the *Deployment Hint*.
