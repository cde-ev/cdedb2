Contributing
============

Contributions should mainly be done by opening pull requests in Gitea. To get
access to the repository, please
`click yourself an account <https://tracker.cde-ev.de/gitea/user/sign_up>`_
and contact us at cdedb Ã¤t lists.cde-ev.de.

We currently do not have any continuous integration. However, its is good style
to write a new or extend an existing test to cover the new introduced code.
Please take a look into :doc:`Development_Workflows_Test_Suite`.

If your contribution requires any additional dependencies or actions to be taken upon
being deployed (such as creating a new database table, column, migrating some data,
etc.), add a file in the ``related/deploy`` folder, containing either a list of
instructions or even better a list of commands, that can directly be executed
to achieve this.

For examples, take a look in the ``related/deploy`` folder and/or the
``cdedb/database/evolutions`` folder and the corresponding doc page
(:doc:`Development_Workflows_Scripts`).
