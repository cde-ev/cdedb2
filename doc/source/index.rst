This documentation is written to fulfill two different goals:

* Give an overview over the design of the CdEDB (mostly interesting for
  developers and other geeks).
* Provide help to use the CdEDB (mostly interesting for normal users).

For the latter, everything should be findable in the **Handbuch**. The remaining
parts of the documentation address the former group.
A small overview where you can find help to which topic:

* **Development**: everything you need to participate actively in the CdEDB-Team.
* **General Design**: the overall concepts behind the CdEDB, including the
  different applications levels, input validation and our role model.
* **Realms**: more specific implementation details, split into the major
  semantic units (realms).
* **API**: a description of the currently existing interfaces to programmatically
  access the CdEDB.
* **Handbuch**: help for specific pages, workflows etc, divided by CdE-groups
  which will be using this application.
* **Archive**: everything which is not important anymore, but kept for
  historical reasons or simply nostalgic ones.
