Logs
----

Logs normally reside in a subdirectory of ``/var/log``.

For cdedb related logs
(i.e. entries generated by the python application itself)
you should look inside ``/var/log/cdedb``.
Logs are split by frontend/backend and their realms.

Apache saves its logs under ``/var/log/apache2``.
The log most relevant for debugging is ``ssl_error.log``.
It contains not only errors from apache itself
but also unhandled exceptions thrown from the cdedb application.
