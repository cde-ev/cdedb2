"""This file provides the central functionality of the subman library.

To manage subscriptions of arbitrary objects, for example mailinglists, journals,
notifications, or magazines the logic one would like to use in a non-trivial
situation is a bit complicated and does not really depend on precise use case.
For more general comments see the documentation.

Specifically, you require the following functions from this library:
* `apply_action` to apply an arbitrary `SubscriptionAction` manually
* `is_obsolete` to cleanup outdated subscriptions from your database

To fully use the power of this library, you additionally need to implement two further
functions:
* a function actually regularly collecting a list of implicit subscriptions and writing
  them directly to the database, so that the subscription machine may act on them.
* a function regularly calling is_obsolete to cleanup all subscribers of a list not in
  a cleanup_protected state. This function may be temporarily turned off for a given
  object without issue.
