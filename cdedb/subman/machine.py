"""This contains most of the logic required to perform actions on subscriptions.

Here, `SubscriptionAction`s are the possible actions to transition from one
`SubscriptionState` to another. Every action will always lead to the same target state,
but there might be multiple actions leading to the same target state.
An action might be allowed from any current state or only from a subset of all states.

It is assumed that there are some users with additional privileges (possibly depending
on the subscription object in question). These privileged users are referred to as
"moderators". Actions restricted to moderators are referred to as "managing actions".

Some actions are meant to be performed automatically somewhat regularly. They are not
meant to be performed manually but rather as a reaction to some change of an external
condition, like a user losing the privilege to subscribe to a certain subscription
object. These actions are referred to as "cleanup actions".

Every user has a certain `SubscriptionPolicy` that defines their relation to any
particular object they could possibly be subscribed to. This determines what actions
they can perform themselves, but also what administrative actions others may perform
for them.
