The documentation can be found under doc/source/*.rst which can be viewed as
html pages at doc/build/html/ after issuing the command 'make doc' (needs
sphinx). Additionally the link manual.html redirects to the documentation
(which is available after running 'make doc') for convenience.

For a setup guide see the INSTALL.html (which is an excerpt of the above
documentation for bootstrapping).
